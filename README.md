# Docker Recipes

This is a repository to contain "recipes" for Docker configurations. Each recipe is created in its own folder, with a README and a collection of examples of the files needed to create it. 

You would create a git clone of your regular repository, add the appropriate Docker files to it, then commit the files to the original repository. 
Then all future clones of the repository will include the files needed to use that repository to launch Docker.

The assumption is that all or most of these recipes will be for local development rather than production, and that these Docker files in the repository would just be ignored on production.
